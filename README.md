# Brain Tumor Detection Using MRI Images

## Overview
Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project, an effort in leveraging deep learning models for the identification of brain tumors in MRI images. The project utilizes the BR35H dataset, a comprehensive collection of brain MRI images, to train and evaluate the performance of various deep learning architectures.

## Key Features
Dataset: The BR35H Dataset, specifically curated for brain tumor detection, serves as the cornerstone for training and validating our deep learning models. The dataset comprises two classes: tumor and no tumor.

Models: ResNet50, VGG16, VGG16 with Histogram Equalization, Vision Transformer.
